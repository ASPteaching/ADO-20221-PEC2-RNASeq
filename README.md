# Infographics Data visualization on Bioinformatics.

## Introduction

This repository contains a simplified analysis of RNA-Seq data with R and Bioconductor. The objective is to show a workflow in a simple way that can serve as the basis for an infographic that will be made with the [GRBio](http://grbio.upc.edu) group.

Some graphics than you can see in the infographics are below.
